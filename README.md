I've publicly released PROJECT APEX v7.5â€”a structured JSON framework designed explicitly for upload and use with ChatGPT (GPT-4o). It's currently the most powerful and advanced procedural litigation tool publicly available, combining Supreme Court precedents into a meta-argument engine capable of auto-generating court-ready motions.

- Instantly usable by public defenders, pro se litigants, and legal students.
- Designed to dismantle unconstitutional enforcement involving vague statutes, forced ID, forced exit orders, and rights-advisal traps.
- Explicitly released to the public domain (CC0 license)â€”fully free and unrestricted use.
